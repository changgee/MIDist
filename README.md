Supplementary Material for Multiple Imputation for Analysis of Incomplete Data in Distributed Health Data Networks

This repository contains the R codes that reproduce the simulation results of the paper.
This codes were tested on R version 3.6.3 and do not require any additional package.


There are
- GenData.R : generates the simulation data
- Sim.R : main code for simulation
- Other internal codes


Instructions for Use
1.	Set the working directory of R to the directory where GenData.R is located.
2.	Run the scripts in GenData.R to generate the simulated data.
3.	Run the scripts in Sim.R to reproduce Tables 2-4.
4. 	Expected completion time of the whole study can be many days on a single CPU. If possible, parallel computing is strongly recommended.
5.	The latex scripts for Tables will be automatically generated by the R scripts.
